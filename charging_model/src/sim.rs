//! The simulation of the energy consumption of the charging stations depends on the following assumptions:
//! - Temporal resolution is 15 minutes (365d * 24 * 4 = 35040 ticks).
//! - Charging station can charge one EV (electric vehicle) at a time.
//! - EV leaves the station as soon as it is finished charging.
//! - All EVs consume 18kWh for a 100km charge.
//!
//! The simulation calculates:
//! - Total energy consumed in kWh
//! - The theoretical maximum power demand
//! - The actual maximum power demand (= the maximum sum of all charge points power
//!   demands at a given 15-minute interval)
//! - The ratio of actual to maximum power demand ("concurrency factor"
